# Natas CTF Walkthrough (From OverTheWire)

This repo contains my detailed write-ups for the first 10 levels of the Natas CTF by OverTheWire. 
I explored core web security concepts like source code analysis, directory traversal, cookie tampering, header spoofing, path traversal, command injection, and more 

â€” with tools like curl, browser DevTools.
